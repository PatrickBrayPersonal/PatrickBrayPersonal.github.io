Philosopher Will MacAskill
Advocates for effective altruism and how 80M humans live on less than $2 a day. I spend $2 on so much stupid shit. Think about the good one could do by giving away money correctly.

## 81: why bother searching for aliens  
  
The fact that we haven’t found intelligent life does not bode well for our species future. If contiued growth is possible surely we would have heard someone already. Barring dark forest.

If an alien civilization is advanced enough to kill us. They must have been peaceful enough not to blow each other up.

## 71: Bombs Away  
“Deterrence Theory” only works in the case of irrational actors.  
If russia were to launch nuclear missiles at Ukraine, the US would be irrational to respond with nuclear force.

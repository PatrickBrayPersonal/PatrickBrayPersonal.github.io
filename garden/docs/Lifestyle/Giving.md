# Giving
## Motivation
With each extra dollar that I earn, I am seeing less value out of it. Saving more. Buying dumber stuff. I want to keep earning money because I have my income closely tied to my sense of self worth. Finding somewhere useful to put my money can allow me to continue to play the fun money game, while still helping others.

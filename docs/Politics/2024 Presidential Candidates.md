>While the US has many vital national interests... becoming further entangled in a **territorial dispute** between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.

This statement is demonstrably false and obviously dangerous. Putin has openly denied the statehood of Ukraine and traced russian roots back to Kiev. A city he tried to quickly take at the onset of the war. To see a candiate accept Putin's 2023 adjusted rhetoric of annexing Russian-speaking provinces is frightening.

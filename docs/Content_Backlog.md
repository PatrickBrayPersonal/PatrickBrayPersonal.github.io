Enhancement ideas for Spotify  
: playlist hierarchy  
You can tag playlists to be combined into one larger playlist  
  
Just think of features designed for your playlisting  
  
Creates a playlist of all songs you have in a playlist owned by you  
  
Perform hierarchical clustering on the playlists  
  
  
Use recency bias: grand finales to cement positive memories. Encore. Etc

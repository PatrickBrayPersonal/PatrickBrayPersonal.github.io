# Data Science
## Pragmatic Programming
### Orthogonality
the components of your software should complete tasks that are different from each other. Limit the overlap.
### Coupling
Avoid coupling between software components, allow them to be interchanged.
### Test-Driven Development
The advantage of tests isn't just that you know your code works. but also you build it decoupled from the rest of the code so it **can** be tested 
### Verision Control
Literally *everything* should be under version control and remote backup. Code and documentation and papers and blog posts. Literally just everything.

## Superforecasters
Crowdsourced internet forecasters were able to outperform intelligence analysts with years of training and access to classified information. This is likely due to a **proper alignment of incentives for accuracy**. 
**wisdom of crowds** and the advantage of well performing **teams** in improving all predictions. Some teams actually hurt the accuracy of their invidivdual members.

The [Good Judgement Project](https://goodjudgment.com/) ran a prediction challenge and were able to make predictions about geopolitical events that outperformed IC analysts.

**Wisdom of crowds** + **aligned incentives** = profit

## Designing ML Systems
*Chip Huyen*
Horror stories of data leaking, models breaking in production, manual workflows at companies give me faith that **I'm not the only one struggling**.
Streaming data is a totally different animal, it is important that your data transforms are the **same in training as in inference**.

Isaac Asimov's collection of short stories in I Robot is incredible

The following Caves of Steel books are a little less timeless but still cool. 

The story's follow a great pattern where a simple concept (the three laws of robotics) is extrapolated, stretched, and played out in many interesting scenarios. The familiar structure makes you think you can see what happens but you're still surprised when it does.

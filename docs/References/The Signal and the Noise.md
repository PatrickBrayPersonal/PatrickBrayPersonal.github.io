## The Signal and the Noise
*Nate Silver*
538 guy gives a strong way of thinking about the way we approach the information we are given.

Establishes the concept of foxes (538 logo) and hedgehogs.

Foxes take in the information there are given and update their beliefs. They actively seek out truth. They are boring.

Hedgehogs see the world through a specific lens and will adapt all new information to fit that narrative. The more information that hedgehogs get, the less accurate their predictions will become. They do well on cable TV.

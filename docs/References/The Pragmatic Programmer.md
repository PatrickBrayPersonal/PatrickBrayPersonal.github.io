This book completely clarified the way I look at programming as a practice. Wholistic view, not just code.
## The Pragmatic Programmer
### Orthogonality
the components of your software should complete tasks that are different from each other. Limit the overlap.
### Coupling
Avoid coupling between software components, allow them to be interchanged.
### Test-Driven Development
The advantage of tests isn't just that you know your code works. but also you build it decoupled from the rest of the code so it **can** be tested 
### Verision Control
Literally *everything* should be under version control and remote backup. Code and documentation and papers and blog posts. Literally just everything.

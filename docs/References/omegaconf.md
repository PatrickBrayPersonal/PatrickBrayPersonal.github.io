OmegaConf is a YAML based hierarchical configuration system, with support for merging configurations from multiple sources (files, CLI argument, environment variables) providing a consistent API regardless of how the configuration was created. OmegaConf also offers runtime type safety via Structured Configs.

This is the base of [[Hydra]] , it has fewer features but it less nonsense to deal with.

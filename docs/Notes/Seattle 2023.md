Visited Dan for the long weekend. We met up and went to a great sushi spot next to his apartment. He lives in Capitol Hill. 

We then bar hopped around and went to a barcade. He gave a big thank you for me coming out to visit! It was great to see him.

Savannah was great and makes Dan super happy. She also didn't take issue with me crashing for 5 days. 

On friday we met up with Degs and toured [[Amazon]]. They seemed super bought in. The corporate structure BS stuff was a little annoying though. The balls are an amazing building. 

We then went to [[Museum of Pop]] which was one of my favorite museums i've ever been to. Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, and guitar exhibits were amazing.

Seattle has a really cool feel. I was always very comfortable and the bars are chill. Lots of coffee and board game stuff. 

We had a good time playing [[Splendor]].

We met up at a lake for Max and Lexi's engagement celebration. Played a lot of spike ball and had a grill out. The weather was beatiful and you could swim in the lake and have a view of mount rainier. Degs and Lexi's techy friends are allegedly not very fun to hangout with and super career oriented. Didn't know how to interact with Savannah not going to college. I do not want to come off like that.

Hanging out with Can, Dan, and Savannah made me feel a bit like a Nomalbob. 

During the week I went to work from the BAH Seattle office. Then caught a flight home. I was a great trip, it is a shame Dan is so far away.
